<h1 class="title">Terminal Path Tracing</h1>

<p>
    This project builds off of my <a href="/projects/rust/terminal-renderer">Terminal Renderer</a> to render an image in
    the terminal.
</p>
<p>
    It currently only contains an unoptimized CPU path tracer wich does not support advanced materials.
    This implementation is a prototype I made to figure out how to architecture one. This project's goal is to
    create a path tracer on the graphics card using the Vulkan API, and have it run in <i>real time</i> in the terminal.
    A full light simulation should be possible as the rendering surface is quite small, and the terminal renderer allows
    to draw images quite fast as long as images are quite close from one frames to the next.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve that goal, I've been reading about Vulkan on the
    <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html">khronos specification page</a>
    and in the <a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/chapters/raytracing.html">vulkan.org documentation</a>. I've
    also been experimenting with <a href="https://github.com/ash-rs/ash">ash</a>, a library implementing Vulkan bindings
    for the rust programming language.
