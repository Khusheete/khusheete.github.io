<h1 class="title">Rust Terminal Renderer</h1>
<p>
    A console renderer library in rust (only supports linux for now).

    It has support for drawing simple shapes, images (with a color used for transparency), and user keyboard and mouse
    input. It implements some optimizations to minimize the number of characted drawn to the console, as printing to it
    is a really slow operation.
