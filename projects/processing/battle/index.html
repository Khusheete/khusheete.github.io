<h1 class="title">Battle</h1>
<p>
    This is a battle simulator. It's the first project I made after I learned about classes. Though as you might see, I didn't know about inheritance
    or anything like that.

    Controls:
    <ul class="bullet-point">
        <li>'p' to pause</li>
        <li>'a' to spawn units on the mouse cursor</li>
        <li>'c' to change unit type</li>
        <li>'r' to remove every unit from the battlefield</li>
    </ul>
