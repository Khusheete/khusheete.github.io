<h1 class="title">Sudoku Solver</h1>

<p>
    A probably inefficient, but working threaded sudoku solver.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    You can move the cursor with the arrow keys and write numbers in the grid. If you want to remove a number,
    type a zero.
    It is possible to save and load sudokus by pressing the 's' or 'o' keys, and pressing 'S' will take a screenshot
    of a solved sudoku.
    You can also stop the solving process by pressing 'n'.
