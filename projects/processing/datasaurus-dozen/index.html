<h1 class="title">Datasaurus Dozen</h1>

<p>
    This project is based on <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs">this paper</a>
    which shows that statistical properties of a dataset (eg. mean, standard deviation, correlation...) are not
    enough to fully understand it: given a dataset with some statistics, it is possible to create an other dataset
    with the same statistics (down to some wanted precision) but with a drasticly different shape (eg. a dinosaur !).
</p>
<p>
    To do that, we nudge datapoints randomly, but only if it keeps the same statistics and
    if the overall distance from the dataset to the desired shape decreases.

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwzzv1biHv8">Here is a video by Stand-Up Maths</a> that explains the paper, 
    and inverviews the creator of the Datasaurus Dozen.
