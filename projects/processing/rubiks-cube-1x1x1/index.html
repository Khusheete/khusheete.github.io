            Here is a cube that rotates, thanks to the black mathematical magic that are quaternions. I heard of those 4D
            complex numbers in a <a url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg">3blue1brown video</a>, and had to
            play around with them. I find it facinating how this seemingly unrelated piece of math can be used for a
            very intuitive and elegant way to model rotations in 3D space.
