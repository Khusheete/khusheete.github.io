<h1 class="title">Territ</h1>
<p>
    This is a small 2 player game prototype. Each player has a color (red or blue) and can (during their turn) place
    squares of his color on a grid, next to one of it's own squares (left click). The goal is to cover the majority of
    the map. (It is possible to right click to claim an completely sealed area.)
