<h1 class="title">Lambda Calculus Implementation</h1>

<p>
    This is an interpreter/repl for a custom &lambda;-calculus dialect I made to play around with this very interesting bit of mathematics and computer science.
</p>
<p>
    It implements both "lazy" and "strict" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#%CE%B2-reduction">&beta;-reduction</a>
    (this is akin to strict and lazy evaluation).
    Strict &beta;-reduction is the usual way programs are executed in most programing languages, and allows to create
    most programs in this &lambda;-calculus dialect. However <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops require some
    use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator">Y combinator</a> which leads to an infinite loop
    when using strict &beta;-reduction. This is why there is a need for lazy &beta;-reduction. It allows the
    implementation of general purpuse loops that can be used afterwards.
