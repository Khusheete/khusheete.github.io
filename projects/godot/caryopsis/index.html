<h1 class="title">Caryopsis</h1>

<p>
    Caryopsis is a semi-casual puzzle game in which you try to optimize a corn genetic mutation process: you have to recreate a specific corn cob by modifying the genes of the plants you have with as few modificaions as possible.
    It was made for the in-person <a href="https://lascienceentreenjeu.fr/scientific-game-jam-8-printemps-2024-edition-lyon/">Scientific Game Jam de Lyon 2024</a>. The jam's goal is to create a game based on a scietific master's thesis.
    We had 24h to find a team (comprised of 2 game developpers, 2 artists, 1 game designer, 1 sound designer, and 1 scientist), debate on how to transform the scientist's thesis into a game, and create it.
</p>
<p>
    After the jam, we decided to work on the game for a few week and polish it before presenting it at the <a href="https://www.museedesconfluences.fr/fr">Mus√©e des Confluences</a> in Lyon.
