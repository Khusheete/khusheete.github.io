<p>
  The Caffeinated Moisture Dispenser 3.0ᵀᴹ (CMD3.0ᵀᴹ) has been unplugged ! As a maintenance bot, your job is to plug it back to save humanity.
</p>

<p>
  We made this game with <a href="https://ohhnyx.itch.io/">Tom Zinck (aka. Ohhnyx)</a> in four days for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025">GMTK Game Jam 2025</a>. The jam's theme was <b>Loop</b>. We immediately thought about time loops and talked about the idea of playing alongside your previous actions. In this game, you can throw some sort of time travel device that allows you to "soft reset the timeline" and replay the level alongside.. yourself ! Everything you did before resetting time is saved and replayed exactly as you did. To solve a puzzle, you'll need to coordinate with your previous iterations to repower the CMD3.0ᵀᴹ.
