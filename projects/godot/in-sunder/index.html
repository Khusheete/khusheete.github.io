<h1 class="title">In Sunder</h1>

<p>
    In this game, you play as someone that has a <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/dissociation-and-dissociative-disorders/about-dissociation/">dissociation disorder</a>.
    Your alarm has just rung and you have to wake up and go to school, but your mind does not want to and you are starting to dissociate. You have to go through puzzles to properly wake up.
    Those puzzles hint to real grounding techniques.

<p>
    I think that the puzzles in this game are a bit too hard, and are quite cryptic. I didn't have a lot of time to properly design and playtest them.
    Originaly I made it for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0">Acerola Jam 0</a>, but I did not have the time to finish it before the deadline.
