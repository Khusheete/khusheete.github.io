<h1 class="title">Mix Match Pro</h1>
<h2 class="title">By Higgaion Games</h2>

<p>
    This is a classical match-3 game in which you have a limited amount of turn to get the highest score.
</p>
<p>
    We made this game to experiment with working with version control systems in a medium sized team. We also decided
    to port it to android to learn how to develop for this platform.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    The game is available to play on itch.io. There are downloads for windows, linux, and android.
