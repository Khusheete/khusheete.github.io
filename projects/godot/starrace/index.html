<h1 class="title">StarRace</h1>

<p>
    This local-multiplayer racing game is a project I made in a few months in highschool with some friends. It is
    definitely not a finished game. We'd have liked to add a few features and race tracks, but it was not possible to
    continue work on this alongside our studies after highschool.

    The game is available to download on <a href="TODO">itch.io</a>.
