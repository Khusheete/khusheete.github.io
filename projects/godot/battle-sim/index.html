<h1 class="title">Battle Sim</h1>

<p>
    This is a battle simulator that makes some AI armies fight one another. Armies are separated in divisions that are
    assigned targets points of interest to defend or attack based on the armies' priorities. A goal would be to create
    a game where the player commands an army by changing the different priorities based on a limited amount of
    information.
</p>

<p>
    Under the hood, this project uses a dev version of <a href="/projects/godot/ait">AIT</a> for AI agents (soldiers,
    division, and armies).
