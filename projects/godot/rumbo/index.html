<h1 class="title">Rumbo</h1>
<h2 class="title">By Higgaion Games</h2>

<p>
    I made this game with 13 people from Higgaion Games, a small community of game developpers. We made it in 14 days for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/advjam2023">Adventure Game Jam</a>.
    However, we decided on a twist: we were not able to communicate during the jam, and we only had 24 hours each to work on the game.
</p>
<p>
    In the game, you play as Rumbo, a character that arrives on an island overrun by monsters. Fighting them will require you to hit quick time events that determine if your attacks are successful or not.

    The game is available on itch.io and is open source on <a href="https://github.com/bonsaipropaganda/advjam2023">github</a> (under the MIT license). Here is a link to the itch page:
