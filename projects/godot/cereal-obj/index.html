<h1 class="title">Cereal Object</h1>

<p>
    This is a serialization format inspired by JSON that I made for the godot engine. The idea was to have a format that
    is strongly typed (unlike json which considers ints and floats the same) and that has support for godot's primitive
    types (Vectors, Transfroms, Rect, AABB, packed arrays...).

    Here is what a cereal object string looks like:

<pre>
{
    a: "b",
    boolean: false,
    not_boolean: true,
    "super duper complex name": true,
    string_array: [String,
        "a",
        "b",
        "c"
    ],
    float_array: [f64,
        1f,
        2f,
        3f,
        -0.0000006f
    ],
    int_array: [i32,
        2,
        1,
        3,
        4,
        7,
        11,
        18,
        29,
        47
    ],
    array: [
        "A",
        2,
        3f,
        {
            nested_stuff: 3.141592654f,
            super_mega_nested: {
                secret: "password"
            }
        }
    ],
    rect: Rect2(1f, 2f; 3.1415f, 4f),
    recti: Rect2i(666i, -42i; 47i, 32i),
    "some vector": Vector2i(6i, 7i),
    aabb: AABB(-5.2f, 7.9f, 3.1415927f; 12.5f, 1f, -95.2f),
    transform: Transform3D(
        0.09597263f, 0.5049345f, 0.132819f  ;
        0.1372523f , 0.8690669f, 0.55455375f;
        0.96561974f, 0.7665665f, 0.1779638f ;
        0.64600086f, 0.8919131f, 0.3106943f
    ),
    crimson: Color(220, 20, 60, 255)
}
