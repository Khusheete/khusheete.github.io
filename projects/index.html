<p>
    These are some of the projects I made over the years. I lost many of my old projects and many more do not work
    anymore. So this is a selection of projects I still have, and that (mostly) don't need to be fiddled with to work.

    The source code of most projects is available under the MIT license, so anyone that can see how they're made and can
    modify them !
