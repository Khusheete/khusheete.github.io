<h1 class="title">Lixy Engine</h1>

<p>
    The Lixy Engine is my first proper game/rendering framework. I wanted to take all the rendering knowledge I've
    acquired and try to create a game engine pretty much from scratch.
</p>
<p>
    It uses flecs for it's ECS and OpenGL for the rendering. It supports loading wavefront <code>.obj</code> 3d
    models and materials. It is build to use the deferred shading technique as objects properties are rendered in a
    gbuffer before being rendered on screen. Though I have not implemented any shading model yet.
