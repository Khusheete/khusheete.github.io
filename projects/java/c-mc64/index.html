<h1 class="title">C-MC64</h1>


<p>
    C-MC64 is an interpreter for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7qxEChJNOMVrfNRKU1mw6g">NOPEname</a>'s
    virtual computer made in minecraft named "MC64". I made it a while back and wanted to have a program that would 
    allow to work on projects for the MC64 computer inside a text file. I never finished the compilier, though the
    interpreter does work.
