        Hi 👋🏽 ! I'm Ferdinand (he/him/they/them). I'm a French computer science student fond of mathematics ♾️, science
        📡, and also video games 🖥️; meaning I'm what people might call a nerd xor a geek xor even both ! I am also an
        open source enthousiast, linux user (though I don't use Arch btw).
    </p>

        I learned programming on my own by creating small games, and visualisation inspired by youtube
        channels such as <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/">The Coding Train</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile">Numberphile</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3blue1brown</a>... I started with
        <a href="http://smallbasic.com">Microsoft Small Basic</a> and then used
        <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> for a while.
        After that, I learned many other languages (Java, C++, Rust...) to see how they work. As of today, I mostly use
        the fantastic <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Game Engine</a> for personal projects.
