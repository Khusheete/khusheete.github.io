        Hallo üëãüèΩ ! I'm Ferdinand (he/him/they/them). I'm a French student, indie game developper and aspiring game
        engine/tooling dev.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a game developper, I'm mostly working on small game projects and on understainding the tech behind game
        engines. My games can be found on my <a href="https://khusheete.itch.io/">itch.io page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I learned programming on my own by creating small games, and visualisation inspired by youtube
        channels such as <a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/">The Coding Train</a>,
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile">Numberphile</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3blue1brown</a>... I started with
        <a href="http://smallbasic.com">Microsoft Small Basic</a> and then used
        <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> for a while.
        After that, I learned many other languages (Java, C++, Rust...) to see how they work. As of today, I mostly use
        the fantastic <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Game Engine</a> for game development.
